##Here we begin how to create the data set of training and test
Read training tables - xtrain / ytrain, subject train
Read the testing tables
Read the features data
Read activity labels data

##Merging of test and training data

merge testdata and train data
Create the main data table merging both table tables - this is the outcome of 1

#Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
#Need to get a subset of all the mean and standards and the correspondongin activityID and subjectID 

#A subtset has to be created to get the required dataset
#Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#The last step is to write the ouput to a text file :
